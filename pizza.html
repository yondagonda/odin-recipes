        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>100ml Mutti Tomato Passata</li>
            <li>2 tbsp chopped basil leaves, plus small leaves to garnish</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove, finely chopped</li>
            <li>4 bocconcini, sliced 1cm thick</li>
            <li>2 tbsp freshly grated parmesan</li>
            <li>8 cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
            <li>Extra virgin olive oil, to drizzle</li>
            <li>2 cups (300g) strong (baker's) flour (see note), plus extra to dust</li>
            <li>7g sachet dry active yeast</li>
            <li>1 tsp caster sugar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra to grease</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>For the pizza bases, sift flour into a large bowl. Stir in yeast , sugar and 1 teaspoon salt. 
                    Make a well in the centre and add 200ml warm water with the oil . 
                    Bring together with a wooden spoon or your hands, then turn out dough onto a floured surface. 
                    Knead for 5 minutes by hand (or in an electric mixer with a dough hook) until the dough is smooth.</li>
                <li>Lightly grease the cleaned bowl with a little oil, then add dough and cover with a tea towel. 
                    Set aside in a warm place to prove for 1 hour or until doubled in size.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 240Â°C. Knock back the dough by punching it to remove air and divide into 2 balls. 
                    Roll dough out on a floured surface until you have 2 very thin, 25cm-diameter pizza bases. 
                    Carefully transfer to 2 lightly floured baking sheets.</li>
                <li>Combine passata or sugo with basil and garlic , then spread over pizza bases leaving a 2cm border. 
                    Divide the bocconcini between bases, then scatter with parmesan and cherry tomatoes (cutside up). 
                    Drizzle with olive oil and bake for 8-10 minutes until cheese has melted and the pizza bases are crisp and lightly golden around the edges.</li>
                <li>Drizzle the pizzas with a little more olive oil, garnish with small basil leaves then serve immediately.</li>
            </ol>
