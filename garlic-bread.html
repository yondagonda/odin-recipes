        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The secret to really good garlic bread is to keep it simple. And to use a lot of garlicâ€”4 cloves for one loaf! 
            Be sure to use freshly shredded parmesan for maximum meltiness ðŸ˜Ž. 
            (You might want to keep some breath mints near by for your breath for after you devour it). 
            This recipe is the perfect side for our Spaghetti Bolognese...or really any Italian pasta dinner. 
            Or honestly? Just serving it by itself with some marinara for dipping is the perfect snack.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 c. (1 stick) butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 baguette or French bread, cut lengthwise</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. freshly chopped parsley</li>
            <li>1/4 c. grated Parmesan</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425Â° and line a large baking sheet with foil.

            <li>Spread cut sides of bread liberally with garlic butter. Sprinkle with Parmesan.</li>
            <li>Bake until bread is toasty and golden at the edges, about 10 minutes.</li>
